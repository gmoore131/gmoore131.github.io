    <h1>CoActive Cap</h1>

    <p>CoActive Cap is a multi-disciplinary private fund that primarily invests in early stage technology companies and Southern California located commercial real estate.</p>

    <p>When investing in early stage startups, we seek out pre-seed and seed stage opportunities specifically in the healthcare and fintech sectors.</p>

    <p>When investing in commercial real estate, we seek to be repeat capital partners to experienced GPs. We do not invest in funds and prefer to establish JVs where we’re the sole equity provider.</p>

    <p>As of Q4 2025, we are actively investing in both themes. If you’re interested in working with CoActive contact <a href="mailto:greg@coactivecap.com">greg@coactivecap.com</a>.</p>
